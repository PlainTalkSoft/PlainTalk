If the rider's token is blank, exit.
If the rider's token is "/c", check for command line arguments given the rider (compile).
If the rider's token is "/l", check for command line arguments given the rider (list).
If the rider's token is "/ss", check for command line arguments given the rider (set subsytem).

Move the rider (command line rules).
Repeat.

Initialize.
Check for command line arguments.
Finalize.
